The following are the class notes for the Integer Linear Programming part of the course Algorithmic Methods for Mathematical Models. There are examples of varied complexity that were explained in class. I have added some commentaries in an effort to make the subject more comprehensible.

I hope these notes can help any student struggling with the subject. Undergraduate Mathematical knowledge is recommended, or required.

I have also included the .tex file for those interested in the mathematical notation.

Best regards,

Wilmer
